# blackjack

this program allows you to play blackjack against a dealer that is randomized

code to run the program: python3 app.py

once you start the game, you will be prompted to select how many games you would like to play. In doing so, you play that amount of games vs. the dealer

Once you are dealt your hand, you will be asked if you want to hit or stand (assuming you have not gotten blackjack from the first deal).
- if you type in "hit" or "h", you will receive another card. if you have not gotten blackjack or have busted, you will be prompted with the same question
- if you type in "stand" or "s", you will not receive another card and the dealer will either start to deal or will stand

Once the winner is confirmed, it will be stated and the game is over
